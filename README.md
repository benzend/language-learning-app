# Language Learning Application with React.js

This application is created using React, using hooks, styled-components, and react-router-dom.
My Goal for this is to become something that people can actually use to get them started in their prefered language.

## Some Difficulties

Firstly, I had to learn react-router-dom. Initially I had just used a hook to change the page to the wanted routes.
But luckily, before this gets too big, I implemented the routes and it was actually extremely easy to understand how to use it.

Secondly, I hadn't had to much exposure to using state (I'm new to React) and I've gotten somewhat comfortable using hooks.
I've used class state, you know, this.state, so it made sense it wouldn't be too difficult. One thing that did annoy me was
the fact you couldn't use the setWhatever too many times or it would throw you an error but I learned how to make the 
app more efficient and use less.

Lastly, making style change according to the current state was foreign to me, but I'm gaining traction with using this. This
comes in handy because of all the matching-type games you need an isCurrent, isCorrect so the styling changes if you click
on this or that and resets if you choose two wrong options or if you do end up getting something correct, it will fade out
becomming unclickable.
